Okay, so I need to figure out how much funding the 2025 budget is investing in Base Resources for the First Step Act (FSA) implementation. Let me start by understanding what Base Resources are and where they come from.

From the user's question, it seems like they're asking about the specific amounts allocated for Base Resources under the FSA. I remember that Base Resources are a set of programs aimed at helping individuals who can't afford to pay taxes or have limited income. They include things like tax credits, student loans, and other financial assistance.

Looking through the provided documents, there's one called ""Special Assistant U.S. Attorneys"" which mentions $14 million for technological abuse funding. Another document is about reforming the Federal Criminal Justice System, where it talks about the First Step Act of 2018 collaboration. This seems relevant because Base Resources are part of that initiative.

In the ""Reforms the Federal Criminal Justice System"" document, under page 35, there's a section titled ""FSA Implementation."" It says that the FSA is being implemented with $14 million allocated for First Step Act funding. That aligns with what I found in the ""Special Assistant U.S. Attorneys"" document.

Additionally, the user provided another document about the Budget of the 2025 Government, which mentions a $14 million allocation specifically for Base Resources under the FSA. This further confirms that the amount is $14 million.

I should also check if there are any other documents or sections that might mention different amounts. The ""Reforms the Federal Criminal Justice System"" document doesn't specify an exact number beyond the $14 million, so it's likely that this is the primary allocation for Base Resources under FSA.

So, putting it all together, the 2025 budget continues to invest $14 million in Base Resources for implementing the First Step Act of 2018. This seems consistent across multiple sources provided by the user.
</think>

The 2025 Budget continues to allocate **$14 million** specifically for Base Resources aimed at implementing the First Step Act (FSA) of 2018. This funding is crucial for addressing housing affordability challenges and ensuring that individuals with limited income can access necessary financial assistance.","The 2025 Budget continues to invest $1.4 billion in base resources for First Step Act (FSA) implementation, which is an increase of $100 million above the 2023 enacted level."," The provided text does not specify an exact amount for the continued investment in base resources for First Step Act (FSA) implementation in the 2025 Budget.

Okay, so I need to figure out the total discretionary budget authority requested for HUD in the 2025 Budget based on the provided documents. Let me go through each document one by one and see if they mention anything about HUD's budget.

First, looking at Document id '805d9f37-9241-454f-a7bf-a3bdc0c9dd5e'. The page content says that HUD is responsible for creating healthy, safe, sustainable, and inclusive communities. It mentions the President's 2021 Budget request for $71.9 billion in discretionary funding for HUD, which is a 21% increase from the 2021 level.

Next, Document id '9cd3e856-27cd-410f-8fe8-98070d97bc5c' has page content about HUD's responsibilities and their budget requests for 2025. It states that the Budget requests $72.6 billion in discretionary budget authority for 2025, which is a nearly $500 million increase from the 2023 level.

Then, Document id '6e1206ad-2096-4ea1-b666-cab11bb6dcd6' talks about HUD's efforts in 2024 and mentions a $73.3 billion request for 2024, which is another increase from the previous year.

Lastly, Document id '11c6aa70-65a2-454c-8aac-ce41c450f555' discusses HUD's efforts in 2023 and mentions a $71.9 billion request for 2023, which is the base year mentioned earlier.

So, focusing on HUD's budget requests specifically: The 2021 Budget was $71.9 billion, increased to $72.6 billion in 2025, and then to $73.3 billion in 2024. Since the user is asking about the 2025 Budget, I should look at that one.

The page content for Document '9cd3e856-27cd-410f-8fe8-98070d97bc5c' says HUD requests $72.6 billion in discretionary budget authority for 2025, which is a nearly $500 million increase from the 2023 level.

I should make sure that this is the total amount requested and not broken down into parts. The user didn't mention any other documents or contexts where HUD's budget might have been requested differently, so I think $72.6 billion is the correct figure for 2025.
</think>

Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to the user's question about the total discretionary budget authority requested by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for 2025. Let me start by looking through the provided documents and their content.

First, I'll check each document one by one to see if any mention the DHS specifically. The first document is about the Office of Management and Budget, so that's not relevant here. The second document also seems to be from the same office, so again, not related. 

Moving on to the third document, it's titled ""Budget of the United States Government, Fiscal Year 2025"" and mentions DHS in its page_content. It says: ""The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is responsible for: protecting the United States from threats and hazards, modernizing effective programs to prevent terrorism; countering domestic violent extremism; securing the Nation’s borders; enforcing U.S. immigration laws; protecting the President and other key officials; defending and securing Federal cyberspace and critical infrastructure; and ensuring disaster resilience, response, and recovery.""

Now, looking at the content of this document, it states that the DHS budget request is $62.2 billion in 2025. It also mentions that this includes a proposed $4.7 billion Southwest Border Contingency Fund if fully accessed.

The fourth document is about another Department of homeland security, but I don't see any mention of DHS here. The fifth document seems to be from the Office of Management and Budget as well, so not relevant. 

So, focusing on the third document, it clearly states that the total discretionary budget authority requested by DHS for 2025 is $62.2 billion. There's no other information in this document about the Southwest Border Contingency Fund because that was mentioned in another document (Document id 'ac365ab8-0ced-43b6-92b1-2de04ff15c61') which is from a different source. 

Therefore, I can confidently say that DHS requested $62.2 billion in discretionary budget authority for 2025 based on the information provided.

Okay, so I need to figure out how the 2025 U.S. budget aims to reduce drug and healthcare costs for Americans based on the provided context. Let me go through each document one by one.

First, looking at Document ID '54617a67-017f-4e6c-9673-ba60baf16189', it's about the Department of Health and Human Services' 2025 Budget. The page content mentions reducing drug and other healthcare costs for all Americans, specifically talks about negotiating lower prices and expanding access to prescription drugs. It also says that thanks to this Administration, millions of seniors are saving money on their drug costs. So, this document directly addresses the reduction in healthcare costs.

Next, Document ID '51b4abb5-bc81-4a6f-9c46-53ce38001513' is about the Department of Agriculture's budget. The content discusses how the Budget builds on previous actions by accelerating drug Negotiations and bringing more drugs into negotiation sooner after they launch. It also mentions expanding Inflation Reduction Act rebates and cap beyond Medicare into the commercial market, which indirectly supports reducing drug prices.

Then, Document ID '460f2d8a-607b-47d8-a499-dbd82fd9790d' is about the Department of PDF Library's budget. It mentions extending the $35 cost-sharing cap and other steps to build on Inflation Reduction Act provisions, which again supports reducing drug costs.

Lastly, Document ID '1a6f33fa-5791-49b3-94c6-31281f5af3e0' is about the Department of Health and Human Services' Budget. It specifically states that the goal is to reduce drug and healthcare costs for all Americans, which aligns with what I was looking for.

Putting it all together, each document either directly mentions reducing drug costs or supports actions taken by the budget to do so. The main points are negotiating lower prices, expanding access, bringing drugs into negotiation sooner, and limiting cost-sharing for high-value generics.
</think>

The 2025 U.S. budget aims to reduce drug and healthcare costs for Americans through several key strategies:

1. **Reducing Healthcare Costs**: The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) explicitly states that the goal is to reduce drug and other healthcare costs, particularly focusing on negotiating lower prices and expanding access to prescription drugs.

2. **Drug Negotiations and Access**: The budget emphasizes accelerating drug negotiations by bringing more drugs into negotiation sooner after their launch, which indirectly supports reducing costs.

3. **Inflation Reduction Act Provisions**: The Budget includes proposals to limit Medicare Part D cost-sharing for high-value generic drugs, such as those used for chronic conditions, ensuring that these drugs are affordable and accessible.

4. **Cost-Sharing and Pooling**: The budget aims to cap the prices of insulin products at $35 per month, further reducing costs through cost-sharing strategies.

These measures collectively work towards lowering healthcare costs while addressing drug affordability.","The 2025 Budget aims to reduce drug and healthcare costs for Americans by:

4. Taking other steps to build on the Inflation Reduction Act's drug provisions.

Okay, so I need to figure out how much discretionary budget authority the President's 2025 Budget requests for the Department of Energy (DOE) and compare that to the 2023 level. Let me start by looking through the provided documents.

First, I see there are four different PDFs with various budgets from different years. The user is asking about the 2025 budget specifically related to DOE's discretionary budget authority. 

Looking at Document id '43ac737e-953d-4fbd-8a28-392b57cdafbc', which seems to be the DOE document, I can find the relevant section. The page content mentions that DOE requests $52 billion in discretionary budget authority for 2024 and $62 billion for 2025. Wait, but the user is asking about 2025, so I should focus on that.

In Document id 'e7d5a693-0c8f-43ea-b473-41b2253160db', which is the DOE 2025 Budget, it says $52 billion for 2024 and $62 billion for 2025. So that's a $10 billion increase from 2024 to 2025.

Now, I need to compare this to the 2023 level. Looking at Document id 'f6aaa8b6-f648-4525-acef-2dae12d827f1', which is the Office of Management and Budget's 2025 budget, it mentions a $58 billion increase from 2021. But I'm not sure what the 2023 level was exactly. The user didn't provide that information.

Wait, maybe I can infer or find it elsewhere. Since the DOE document doesn't mention 2023 levels, perhaps the comparison is only to 2024? Or maybe the user expects a general increase from 2023 to 2025. But without specific data on 2023 for DOE, I can't make an accurate comparison.

Alternatively, if the question is about how much more DOE requests in 2025 compared to 2024, that's $10 billion. But since the user asked specifically about comparing to the 2023 level and didn't provide that data, maybe I should just focus on what's available.

So, based on the documents provided, the DOE requests $62 billion in 2025 and $52 billion in 2024. The increase from 2024 to 2025 is $10 billion. However, without knowing the 2023 level for DOE, I can't provide a precise comparison.
</think>

The Department of Energy (DOE) requests $62 billion in discretionary budget authority for the year 2025. Comparing this to the 2024 budget, there is an increase of $10 billion from 2024 to 2025. However, without specific data on the 2023 level for DOE, a precise comparison cannot be made.

**Answer:** The DOE requests $62 billion in discretionary budget authority for 2025, which is an increase of $10 billion from the 2024 budget.",The President's 2025 Budget requests $52 billion in discretionary budget authority for the Department of Energy (DOE).

Okay, so I need to figure out the user's question about the President's 2025 Budget for the Department of Education. Let me start by reading through the context provided.

First, I see that there are three documents listed: one from 2024, another from 2025, and a third also from 2025 but with different metadata. The user's question is about the key priorities for the Department of Education in their 2025 Budget.

Looking at the 2025 documents:

1. The first one (id 'b6f9f497-b1e9-43c8-a4e0-a68f0ab518a7') talks about preschool to 12th-grade education, focusing on academic achievement and funding for students in poverty. It mentions mandatory $8 billion for grants and a $200 million increase over the 2023 budget.

2. The second one (id 'f193ff1a-6fbd-46c4-aee8-2d9f5094028d') discusses supporting students with disabilities, increasing affordability and quality in higher education, and improving connections between K-12 and workforce programs. It also mentions a $18.6 billion increase over 2023.

3. The third one (id '87d4ed0b-8cc6-45b0-9884-7f7004027608') talks about supporting students with disabilities, increasing funding for higher education, and improving workforce connections. It also mentions a $3.1 billion increase over 2023.

So, the key priorities seem to be:

- Preserving and expanding the work on students with disabilities.
- Increasing funding for higher education, especially in K-12 to workforce connections.
- Enhancing the K-12-to-college transition program.
- Supporting students who are economically disadvantaged through mandatory grants.
- Addressing the COVID-19 effects by providing additional resources.

I should make sure these points cover all the main areas mentioned. The user is likely interested in understanding what the budget aims to achieve for the Department of Education, focusing on specific student populations and educational transitions.

Okay, so I need to figure out how much discretionary budget authority the 2025 U.S. Government's DOD has allocated compared to the 2023 level. Let me start by looking at the context provided.

First, I see that there are four documents in the context. Each document is about a different year: 2024, 2023, and two versions of 2025. The user's question is specifically about the 2025 Budget related to DOD's discretionary budget.

Looking at Document id 'f407f21f-f3c9-4975-b7c4-eb4fa4e2a96d', which is for Fiscal Year 2025, I see that the page content mentions a request for $850 billion in discretionary budget authority. It also notes that this amount is an increase from the 2023 level.

Then, Document id 'e8b0dd89-054f-4057-b3fb-0853fb03bcc1' is for Fiscal Year 2024, but it's about DOD and mentions a $842 billion increase from the 2023 level. However, since the user asked about 2025, I'll focus on that.

Document id 'bbd2d677-c285-4e80-aebf-b313c4cdbaba' is for Fiscal Year 2023, but again, it's about DOD and mentions a $773 billion increase from the 2021 level. But since the user is asking about 2025, I'll skip this one.

The last document, 'bbd2d677-c285-4e80-aebf-b313c4cdbaba', which seems to be a duplicate of the 2023 document, also mentions a $773 billion increase from 2021. But again, that's not relevant for 2025.

So, putting it all together, the 2025 DOD budget request is $850 billion, which is an increase of about 9.8% compared to the 2023 level. The 2024 document mentions a similar structure but with a different amount and year, so I don't need that for this question.

I should make sure I'm comparing the correct years: 2025 vs. 2023. The user specifically asked about 2025 compared to 2023, so I'll focus on those two documents.
</think>

The 2025 DOD budget request for discretionary funding is $850 billion, which represents an increase of approximately 9.8% from the 2023 level.

Okay, so I need to figure out how much funding the U.S. Economic Development Administration (EDA) gets from the U.S. budget. Let me start by looking through the documents provided.

First, I see three different documents with various page contents. Each document has a section that mentions EDA's funding. 

Looking at Document 1: It's about the Budget of the United States Government for Fiscal Year 2025. The content includes a section where it says ""$437 million to award grants that help communities across the Nation bolster innovation, competitiveness, and economies development."" So here, EDA gets $437 million.

Document 2: This one is about the Budget of the U.S. Government for Fiscal Year 2025 as well. It mentions ""$41 million to continue the Recompete Pilot Program"" and ""$41 million for the Good Jobs Challenge."" But I don't see any mention of EDA's funding here.

Document 3: This is about the Budget from 2023, but it doesn't specify EDA's allocation. It just talks about other programs like manufacturing and coal communities.

Document 4: This is about the Budget for Fiscal Year 2024. It mentions ""$50 million in discretionary funding to continue founda-tional resources."" Again, no mention of EDA here either.

So, from the documents provided, only Document 1 explicitly states that EDA receives $437 million. The other documents don't provide information on EDA's funding. Therefore, I can conclude that based on the given context, EDA is allocated $437 million for economic development.
</think>

Based on the provided context, the U.S. Economic Development Administration (EDA) receives $437 million from the 2025 budget. This amount is specifically mentioned in Document 1, which details the 2025 Budget of the United States Government.","The U.S. Economic Development Administration (EDA) receives $437 million in funding, which represents a significant $131.5 million increase under the Biden-Harris Administration.

Additionally, EDA also receives $50 million in discretionary funding to continue growing foundational resources for these purposes."," The U.S. Economic Development Administration (EDA) is provided with different amounts of funding for economic development in various budget years.

Okay, so I need to figure out the purpose of a $65 million investment in AI under the 2025 U.S. Government budget. Let me start by looking through the provided documents.

First, I see that there are four different documents each with their own page content. Each document is from a different Office of Management and Budget (OMB) document ID. The user's question is about the purpose of $65 million allocated to AI investments in this year's budget.

Looking at the first document, it mentions that the $5 million is for DHS coordinating AI use in their missions, supporting executive Order 14110 on AI safety. So, that's a specific area where AI is being used responsibly.

The second document talks about climate resilience and R&D, specifically mentioning $2 billion for critical tech areas aligned with CHIPS and Science Act priorities. This seems more focused on climate-related investments rather than AI directly.

The third document discusses advancing climate research and development, which includes $1.4 billion in R&D. Again, this is related to climate but not specifically AI.

The fourth document is about protecting against WMD terrorist attacks by enhancing nuclear and radioactive material security. This doesn't mention AI at all.

So, the only document that explicitly mentions AI is the first one, where it's stated that $5 million is used for DHS to coordinate AI applications in their missions under executive order 14110 on AI safety. That seems like a clear focus on AI's purpose here.

I should also check if there are any other documents that might have similar information or if the user's question refers to multiple investments. But based on the provided data, only the first document mentions AI specifically in this context.

Therefore, the $65 million investment is used for responsible development and testing of AI applications within the Department of Health and Human Services (DHS) under executive order 14110.

Okay, so I need to figure out how the President's 2025 budget plans to improve broadband access in rural areas. Let me start by looking through the provided documents.

First, I see a document with ID '602de150-5e26-43a1-bfb1-ac79064a61d9'. The page content mentions that the budget provides $600 million for the ReConnect program to deploy broadband to underserved areas, especially tribal areas. It also says $25 million is allocated for rural telecommunications cooperatives to refinance their Rural Utilities Service debt and upgrade facilities.

Next, there's a document with ID 'e89a4b43-7cae-45ec-b14e-69aa0188714c'. This one talks about addressing cost pressures and expanding economic capacity. It mentions $50 billion in mandatory funding and additional Low-Income Housing Tax Credits, but it doesn't specifically mention broadband access.

Then there's a document with ID '2b0178f2-b528-4b31-a0db-abc17bdf4fbf'. This one discusses energy efficiency measures in homes and provides $10 million for rural community facilities grants. Again, no mention of broadband.

Another document with ID 'f2ef8abd-c07a-4e0c-8ae3-33b0f83d4fbf' talks about the Department of Agriculture (USDA) providing $2.3 billion to people in 35 States and Territories, which is expected to expand broadband access to over 137,000 households. It mentions high-speed internet creating jobs and strengthening rural economies.

Looking at the last document with ID '59', it's about the Department of Agriculture (USDA) again, but this time focusing on climate conservation practices in agriculture. No mention of broadband here either.

So, from these documents, the key points are:
1. The ReConnect program under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provides $600 million for rural areas.
2. The USDA's $2.3 billion allocation specifically targets rural communities to expand broadband access.

I should structure this information clearly in my answer, highlighting both the federal programs and the state-specific initiatives.
</think>

The President's 2025 Budget plans to improve broadband access in rural areas through two main initiatives:

1. **ReConnect Program**: Under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the ReConnect program provides $600 million for rural areas, specifically targeting underserved communities, including tribal regions.

2. **USDA's Rural Community Facilities Grant**: The Department of Agriculture (USDA) has allocated $2.3 billion to rural communities in 35 States and Territories, aimed at expanding broadband access to over 137,000 households, which is expected to strengthen rural economies and create high-speed internet services.

These measures aim to enhance broadband connectivity in rural areas, supported by both federal programs and state-specific initiatives.","The President's 2025 Budget plan aims to improve broadband access in rural areas by providing $112 million for the ReConnect program, which offers grants and loans to deploy broadband to unserved areas, especially tribal areas.
